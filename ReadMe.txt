This code parses Yahoo Finance for the latest close prices as well as other attributes. This uses yahoo-finance 1.4.0 to get the data:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance
Currently the ticker symbols are imported from companylist.csv which are then used to get attributes from the stock.
Code can be modified to the attributes that are needed. Changes the length of the for loop to 3270 to get the complete list. 
Warning, this takes time.
